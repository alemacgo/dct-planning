BlocksQBF is a generator for random quantified boolean formulae (QBF)
in QDIMACS format [1]. In essence, it is an implementation of the
model described in [2].

To compile the generator, unpack the sources and run 'make'. Call
'./blocksqbf -h' for usage information and an example. BlocksQBF
writes the generated formula to stdout, where it prepends its
configuration used for generating the formula as QDIMACS comments.
